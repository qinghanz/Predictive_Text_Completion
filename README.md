# Predictive_Text_Completion

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates predictive text completion using a Flask backend and a React frontend. It predicts the completion of input text by using natural language processing (NLP) libraries and models. In this case, one popular library for text prediction is (Hugging Face's Transformers library) was used.

The application consists of two parts:

Backend: Implemented using Flask, a Python web framework.
Frontend: Implemented using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Install dependencies: In the project's root directory, run the following command to install the required Python dependencies:

"pip install flask"

Run the backend: In the project's root directory, execute the following command to start the Flask backend server:

"python app.py"

### Frontend

Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

Install dependencies: In the project's frontend directory, run the following command to install the required JavaScript dependencies:
